    "# Secure Serving\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a modified version of [Part 11 - Secure Deep Learning Classification](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FOpenMined%2FPySyft%2Fblob%2Fdev%2Fexamples%2Ftutorials%2FPart%252011%2520-%2520Secure%2520Deep%2520Learning%2520Classification.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your data matters, your model too\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is the driver behind Machine Learning. Organizations who create and collect data are able to build and train their own machine learning models. This allows them to offer the use of such models as a service (MLaaS) to outside organizations. This is useful as other organizations who might not be able to create these models themselves but who still would like to use this model to make predictions on their own data. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, a model hosted in the cloud still presents a privacy/IP issue. In order for external organizations to use it - they must either upload their input data (such as images to be classified) or download the model. Uploading input data can be problematic from a privacy perspective, but downloading the model might not be an option if the organization who created/owns the model is worried about losing their IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing over encrypted data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, one potential solution is to encrypt both the model and the data in a way which allows one organization to use a model owned by another organization without either disclosing their IP to one another. Several encryption schemes exist that allow for computation over encrypted data, among which Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), Homomorphic Encryption (FHE/SHE) and Functional Encryption (FE) are the most well known types. We will focus here on Secure Multi-Party Computation ([introduced in detail here in tutorial 5](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/dev/examples/tutorials/Part%205%20-%20Intro%20to%20Encrypted%20Programs.ipynb)) which consists of private additive sharing. It relies on crypto protocols such as SecureNN and SPDZ, the details of which are given [in this excellent blog post](https://mortendahl.github.io/2017/09/19/private-image-analysis-with-mpc/). \n",
    "\n",
    "These protocols achieve remarkable performances over encrypted data, and over the past few months we have been working to make these protocols easy to use. Specifically, we're building tools to allow you to use these protocols without having to re-implement the protocol yourself (or even necessarily know the cryptography behind how it works). Let's jump right in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact setting in this tutorial is the following: consider that you are the server and you have some data. First, you define and train a model with this private training data. Then, you get in touch with a client who holds some of their own data who would like to access your model to make some predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You encrypt your model (a neural network). The client encrypts their data. You both then use these two encrypted assets to use the model to classify the data. Finally, the result of the prediction is sent back to the client in an encrypted way so that the server (_i.e._ you) learns nothing about the client's data (you learn neither the inputs or the prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we would additively share the `client`'s input between itself and the `server` and vice versa for the model. For the sake of simplicity, the shares will be held by two other workers `alice` and `bob`. If you consider that alice is owned by the client and bob by the server, it's completely equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation is secure in the honest-but-curious adversary model which is standard in [many MPC frameworks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03239.pdf).\n",
